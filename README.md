Getting started

If there's one thing I've learned in life it's that being perfect is impossible - in fact most of the time I'm terrible compared to perfection. But trying to reach perfection, while impossible, is not a bad way to attain some very high goals. So I'll be terrible - for now, because tomorrow I'll be closer to perfection.
